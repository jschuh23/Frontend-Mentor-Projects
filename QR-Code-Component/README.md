## MY PROCESS

### Built with

<!-- -   Mobile-first workflow with breakpoints at:
    -   1000px
    -   1100px
    -   1000px - 1170px
-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS Flexbox
-   Logical properties used for margin and padding -->

### Continued development

<!-- -   I continued learning about CSS flexbox and grid during this challenge as I used these techniques to layout the different components. -->

### Lessons learned

<!-- -   I did additional research into creating this design in landscape orientation. I have learned that my initial settings for the html and body heights don't seem to be working appropriately when in landscape. NEED TO RESEARCH MORE -->
