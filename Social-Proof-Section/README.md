## MY PROCESS

### Built with

-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS Flexbox and Grid
-   Logical properties used for margin and padding

### Continued development

-   I continued learning about CSS flexbox and grid during this challenge as I used these techniques to layout the different components.

### Lessons learned

-   I researched how best to place hanging puncutations on blockquotes. The CSS property 'hanging-punctuation' is currently not supported in many browsers. I found an article on CSS Tricks that provides syntax to use when the property is not supported and for those browsers where it is supported.
