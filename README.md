# Frontend Mentor Projects

This repository contains all of the Frontend Mentor projects that I've completed.  Each project folder contains a `README.md` file which details the following:

- Specifics about the project challenge
- Image(s) of the final project
- Link(s) to the final project
- My process for building the project
- Areas that I continue to develop in
- Lessons that I learned while working on the project
- Resources that I found useful

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.
